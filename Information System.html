                <p>Information Systems (IS) is the study of how technology, people, and processes work together to collect, manage, and use information in organizations. This course focuses on understanding how businesses use systems and tools to improve operations, make decisions, and solve problems. Unlike pure computer science, Information Systems combines technology with business principles, teaching students how to analyze and design systems that support organizational goals. The course is ideal for those interested in both technology and how it applies to business strategies and management.
